This folder contains notebooks from several different ideas for the project that I then switched directions on. My first idea was to scrape songs from Spotify for micro-genre classification, but I determined that I would rather use a pre-scraped and labeled dataset and spend more time on the other aspects of the project then focus on scraping and building my own lyrics corpus. Since I do know how to do it and essentially just need to loop the code and connect it with lyrics, it is an easily viable way to add more genres if I were to continue this research. Additionally, I tried to make glove embeddings but I had many issues with downloading the software on my computer. It would have led to me rebooting and wiping my entire system, which I did not want to risk. Thus, I decided to create the Word2Vec embeddings.
