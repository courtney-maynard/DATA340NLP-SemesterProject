All notebooks in the folder contain the code that I wrote to analyze the data and do the entire project.

The pre-processing steps for the data are included in 'songDataExploration_Preprocessing'. Due to size limits, I can not include the original training data in this repo. However, it is downloadable from the following link, and you could then follow the same preprocessing steps from the notebook to get the results. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateibejan/multilingual-lyrics-for-genre-classification


When looking at the models, I recommend starting with the 'baselineLogisticRegressionModel' notebook, as it has the most explanations (some aspects are repeated in the other notebooks) and also contains my code for creating the custom Word2Vec model.
