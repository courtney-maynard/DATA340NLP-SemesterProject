All notebooks in the folder contain the code that I wrote to analyze the data and do the entire project. I recommend starting with the 'baselineLogisticRegressionModel' notebook, as it has the most explanations (some aspects are repeated in the other notebooks) and also contains my code for creating the custom Word2Vec model.
